# ðŸ’¬ Intelligent RAG E-commerce Chatbot

Developed a Streamlit-based chatbot, enhancing user experience by ~60% and revenue potential by ~40% with a conversational interface. Integrated RAG with LLaMA 3.3 (Groq), semantic routing, and real-time SQL to replace inefficient filters and FAQs, reducing API costs by ~50% using HuggingFace embeddings, ChromaDB, and quantization.



This chatbot currently supports two intents:

- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
